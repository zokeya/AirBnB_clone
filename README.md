Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

Each task is linked and will help to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
